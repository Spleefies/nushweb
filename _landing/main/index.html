	<p>
        Welcome to NUSHWeb, a web portal created by the students of NUS High School! This website is <strong>not affiliated with the school in any way</strong> - it's just a side project of the creators.
    </p>

                <h2>Open NUSHWeb</h2>
            </button>

            <h2>Full Integration</h2>
            <p>
                NUSHWeb utilises the school-issued email/Microsoft accounts to enable users to login, removing the need for students to re-register.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students' names and Microsoft IDs are only stored on the user's device. Personalisation features are stored on the backend, which stores only users' student ID (a 7-digit number created by the school and available through Microsoft login).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Convenience and Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                The website can be installed as a web app on the user's mobile device, enabling more features that you would expect to see in a native app.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app can then be accessed via an icon on the user's home screen, for quick and convenient access.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Familiarity</h2>
            <p>
                The home page of the portal shares some common features with the MOE <a href="https://learning.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Student Learning Space</a> portal, which most students would already be familiar with.
                In addition, some common features found on other websites are also present.
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows first-time users to quickly familiarise themselves with the features of the application.
